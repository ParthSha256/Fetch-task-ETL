Questions : 

Question 1 : How would you deploy this application in production?

Answer : I would use Docker to containerize this application, generate an image, 
	 and submit it to a container registry (like Docker Hub or Amazon ECR) in order to deploy it in production. 
         Then, to handle scalability, load balancing, and monitoring, I would deploy the containers using an 
         orchestration platform like Kubernetes or Amazon ECS.

Question 2 :  What other components would you want to add to make this production ready?

Answer : To maintain data reliability and integrity in a production environment, I would need to incorporate error handling, logging, monitoring, and retry procedures. 
         I might also include authentication and authorisation for SQS and the Postgres database.
         I may use a message queuing system (like RabbitMQ or Apache Kafka) to efficiently handle high message volumes and decouple the components.

Question 3 : How can this application scale with a growing dataset.

Answer : Through the use of container orchestration solutions like Kubernetes or Amazon ECS, this application can scale to handle a rising dataset. 
         These tools allows to set the number of container instances to scale automatically dependent on the rate of incoming messages. 
         To parallelize the processing of messages from the SQS queue, more workers could be utilized.

Question 4 : How can PII be recovered later on?

Answer : Since this approach uses one-way hash algorithms for masking, PII cannot be extracted from the masked data. 
	 Instead of using one-way hashing, you would need to utilize a reversible encryption technique if the requirement is to recover PII later. 
	 In order to maintain data privacy, this would necessitate securely maintaining the encryption keys.

Question 5 : What are the assumptions you made?

Answer : The obtained JSON data from the SQS queue is assumed to have the predetermined structure. 
	 The format of the supplied app_version is "major.minor.patch," and it is always accurate. 
	 The required user_logins table has also been created, and the Postgres database is operating. 
	 Finally, this method makes the assumption that SHA256 hashing satisfies the masking condition. 
	 More elaborate masking techniques can be required depending on the security needs and the sensitivity of the data.
